### Simple Linear Regression Project - California Housing Price Prediction
#### Objective:
The project applied Simple Linear Regression (SLR) to predict California Housing Prices based on a single predictor variable.
#### Key Steps & Results:
1. Regression Coefficients Estimation:
Slope (Regression Coefficient): 0.4179
Intercept (Bias): 0.4509
2. Fitted Regression Line:
The best-fitted line was plotted, showing the relationship between the predictor variable and housing prices.
3. Model Evaluation:
Error Variance: Computed to evaluate model prediction accuracy.
Standard Errors: The standard errors for both the slope and intercept were calculated to measure the reliability of the estimates.
Confidence Intervals: Confidence intervals for the slope and intercept were computed, providing a range of values where the true parameters likely fall.
4. Model Adequacy:
R-Squared: The model's adequacy was reflected by an R-squared value of 0.47, indicating the predictor explains 47% of the variance in the housing prices.
#### Conclusion:
The Simple Linear Regression model provides useful insights, with a slope of 0.418 and intercept of 0.451. While the R-squared of 0.47 suggests that the model captures a moderate amount of variance, the model can potentially be improved with additional predictors.
